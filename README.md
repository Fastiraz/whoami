I am Fastiraz. Just a guy who love tech (offensive security). I'm curious and very involved in my projects and always give my best. I enjoy working because I'm passionate about what I do. My greatest assets are my versatility, autonomy and creativity. i'm also a CTF player, developer and Linux lover.

## ðŸ’­ Some Dreams

My professional dreams are companies that I want to work for one day in my life.

1. The first company is [Proton AG](https://proton.me/). I love what they do. We share the same goals, security, privacy, and open-source.

2. The second is [Synacktiv](https://www.synacktiv.com). I personally think that they are the best in France in terms of offensive security (after the DGSE ðŸ˜…). I'm very passionate about offensive security and I want to learn more so that I can progress as much as possible. That's why I want to join Synacktiv one day. It will allow me to be surrounded by the best and to acquire skills that I would never get anywhere else.

3. Google. Wait, you really want to know why?
